OOP
programming technique to write programs based on the real world objects


advantages of OOPS
Simplicity

Modularity

Modifiability

Extensibility

Maintainability

Reusability



What are the four basic principles/ building blocks of OOP (object oriented programming)?

Inheritance
Encapsulation
Abstraction
Polymorphism

Inheritance :
The Child inherits the properties of the Parent

class Parent { ... }

class Child extends Parent { ... }




Encapsulation :
bind your data and code together as a single unit
hide your data in order to make it safe from any modification

We can achieve encapsulation in Java by:

Declaring the variables of a class as private.
Providing public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables values.




Abstraction :
Data abstraction is the process of hiding certain details 
and showing only essential information to the user. 
Abstraction can be achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces 





Polymorphism :
‘poly’ means many and ‘morph’ means forms
define one interface or method and have multiple implementations
